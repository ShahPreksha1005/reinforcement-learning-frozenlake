# reinforcement-learning-frozenlake
This repository explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) using OpenAI Gym (now Gymnasium) with the FrozenLake-v1 environment. It covers key RL concepts, environment setup, and agent interactions, including deterministic policy implementation. The project demonstrates state-action-reward cycles and navigation strategies in a grid-based world.
